### Notebook Series Description:

The two notebooks presented here introduce to the use of DORADO, a lagrangian particle tracking model that uses hydrodynamic informations from any model to compute the paths of particles, given buoyancy characteristics. In the present case, DORADO is applied to the output of the ANUGA hydrodynamic model computed in [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/soloyant/deltax_workshop_2024/blob/main/tutorials/1_HydrodynamicModeling_ANUGA/[3]ANUGA_model_run.ipynb)[3]ANUGA_model_run.ipynb: a simple simulation of the water flow in a user-defined subregion of interest in the Mississippi River Delta, LA, USA.

### Necessary Datasets:

Please ensure that all the following datasets were downloaded and placed into the "data" subfolder. Zip files should be unziped in the same folder, keeping the original tree structure intact.
